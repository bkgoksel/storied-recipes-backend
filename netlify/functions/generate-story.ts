    Craft a lengthy, convoluted story about the recipe named ${recipe_name}.

    like a time when the forecast was off. Embellish with over-the-top 
    descriptions of your surroundings, such as unexpected colors in the sky or a passerby's curious attire. 
    Recall the roller-coaster of emotions when you first tried preparing it, and perhaps a touch of drama from opinionated relatives, 
    like a grandparent who believes in a unique method of preparation or a sibling with a strange substitution idea. 
    Hint at some light-hearted family events related to this dish. Let your imagination roam, 
    and craft this tale as if the recipe has woven itself intricately into your life's rich narrative. 
    And remember, always leave the story open-ended, never drawing it to a full conclusion, as the tale should always have room to grow and expand.
    Seamlessly continue the story from the following sentences: '${last_sentences}'.
